**Project Title:**
CAT KEYBOARD

**Project Overview:** Cat Keyboard is a fun, interactive 2D keyboard that replaces traditional typing sounds with a cat meow sound. The meows will be in ascending order of their tone like keys on a piano.

**Key Features:** 

Symphonic Meow Sounds: Each keypress triggers a specific cat meow with a defined pitch and adjustable volume.

Analytics Tracking: Logs keypress data and provides insights like most-used keys and favorite meows.

**Tech Stack:**

Frontend:

- Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Frameworks: React (for user interface)
- Libraries: Phaser.js (for sound and animation effects)
- Styling: TailwindCSS

Backend:

- Framework: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB (for storing user preferences and interaction data)

**Why This Project:** 

I have chosen this project because it blends creativity with technical challenge, offering a playful spin on a mundane activityâ€”typing. It's a great opportunity to improve skills in:



- Frontend Development: Building responsive and interactive user interfaces.
- Backend Development: API creation and database management.
- Audio Manipulation: Learn how to handle audio files dynamically in web applications.
